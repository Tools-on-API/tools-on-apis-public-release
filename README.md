## üß† AI Assistant (Model to be decided)
**Please note** that this API is currently under development and will take a little time as of 20th June 2025, to get the API running at the best price you people ;-)

  "prompt": "Summarize benefits of yoga"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "response": "Yoga improves flexibility, focus..."

## üöÄ Deployment

Deployed using:

* **Quart** for Flask-compatible, but async, endpoints
* **Uvicorn** for production ASGI server 
#### All on Python version 3.12.

---

All APIs follow the REST structure of Response.

* 400 - Bad Request. You did something wrong.
* 500 - Server Error. I did something wrong.
* 200 - Ok. You good, me good.
* 404 - Not Found. Check the URL.
* Other errors are yet to be declared (Because I am going to implement authentication as well).

---

This project is under my goal of being completely open souce, and create APIs such that my fellow developers won't have to write codes for anything again and again. Just call the API from client side itself, and boom, no need to write new code, new endpoints, fall into the hassle. Just put a request on RapidAPI, and get your work done.

---

Of course this is not going to be a thing possible to be done by a single human. I need your help as well. Do post PRs, give suggestions as of what all to add, update, patch or whatever on the repository.
